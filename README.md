# pandas-challenge: Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

## Background

The ask was to complete one out of two Data Challenges. I chose to go with the **Option 2: PyCitySchools** challenge as my professional career has been in education administration. 

The challenge has been completed as below:

* The analysis was done using the pandas library and Jupyter notebook. 

* All files are inside the folder named for the challenge `PyCitySchools`. This folder contains:

    * A Jupyter notebook called `PyCityschools.ipynb` to run the analysis.

    * A `Resources` folder that contains the CSV files `schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv`. These files contain details on all students, their math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Our responsibility was to aggregate the data and to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

    * An `Analysis` folder that contains a Word document with my analysis, the same as the 'Analysis' section below.

* District schools have significantly lower performance than Charter schools, as shown in the
